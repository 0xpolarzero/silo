# SiloUI review remediation: design notes

Decision records for the items marked **design** in Phase 0 of the
[review remediation plan](SiloUI-REVIEW-REMEDIATION-PLAN.md). Owner decisions
come from [the 2026-09-29 review](research/codebase-review-2026-09-29.md).
Written 2026-09-29 against `main` at `edd30ae`. Every item follows
`AGENTS.md` "Reuse established tools".

**Evidence labels.** *Verified* means read in this repository or fetched from a
primary source on 2026-09-29. *Assumed* means taken from memory or an
inference that still needs a test. Where a source was read through a
summarising fetch rather than line by line, the note says so.

Sources checked:

- MicroSandbox pin: `app/SiloUI/runtime-inputs.json` (0.7.2, commit `60d4dc8`)
  and the single Silo patch `app/SiloUI/patches/microsandbox-silo-network-0.7.2.patch`,
  which does not touch snapshot or archive code (verified with grep).
- MicroSandbox v0.7.2 `docs/sandboxes/snapshots.mdx` and
  `sdk/rust/lib/backend/local/snapshot/archive.rs` (both read through a summarising fetch).
- tao `dev` `src/platform_impl/macos/app_delegate.rs` (summarising fetch);
  the locked version is tao 0.35.3 (`Cargo.lock`).
- Tauri single-instance plugin guide, <https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/single-instance/>,
  and plugin source `plugins-workspace/v2/plugins/single-instance`
  (`Cargo.toml`, `src/platform_impl/macos.rs`; summarising fetch).
- GitHub REST docs, "Create an installation access token for an app".
- `Cargo.lock`: `zbus` 5.19 and 4.4, `parking_lot` 0.12.5, and `thiserror` 2 are
  already in the dependency graph, so none of them adds a new supply-chain root.

## D-02: per-VM snapshot reads instead of the computer-wide idle check

**Problem.** `read_application_snapshot_once` rejects the whole read with
UPDATING whenever `OPERATIONS.is_idle()` is false. That includes hidden
housekeeping and work on unrelated VMs. As a result, one checkpoint or slow
boot freezes every row, and the first read at launch fails
(`runtime.rs:1748,1851`, `operation_gate.rs:579`). Related: H-37 and the F
update-readiness check.

**Options.**

1. Keep the global check and exclude hidden entries.
2. Settle each VM separately: read everything, then keep a VM's fresh fields
   only if `is_vm_idle(id)` holds and its generation is unchanged. Otherwise
   return that VM's previous value marked `settling`.
3. Use a versioned store with a revision per VM (for example `arc-swap`).

`is_vm_idle` and `generation(id)` already exist (`runtime.rs:1939` uses the
same pattern). Option 3 adds a subsystem this problem does not need.

**Decision.** Option 2, plus option 1 for computer-scoped fields. Hidden
entries never make a read stale. A computer-scoped visible operation marks only
the computer-level fields as settling.

**Outline.**

1. `operation_gate.rs`: add `is_idle_visible()` and a `snapshot_epoch(id)` that
   returns the generation together with the idle state.
2. `runtime.rs`:
   - Replace the `&|| OPERATIONS.is_idle()` predicate with a per-VM filter.
   - Remove the `Err(UPDATING)` return for partial overlap.
   - Add `settling: bool` per VM to the contract.
3. H (`production-source.ts`): never replace a fresher VM reading with a
   settling one (H-37).
4. `updates.rs:169`: use `is_idle_visible()`.

**Tests.**

- A running op on VM A leaves B's reading fresh.
- A hidden log cleanup never yields UPDATING.
- The launch read succeeds while `start_at_launch` runs.

**Open question.** Should settling rows show a spinner, or silently keep the
last value?

## E-03: checkpoint deletion with fork dependencies and native snapshot cleanup

**Problem.** Silo never removes native snapshots. Restore, Fork and failed
captures or imports accumulate full-size members. Deleted sandboxes leave
orphans, and the 1 MiB index eventually breaks export and import (E-03, E-23,
owner decision 9).

**What 0.7.2 supports** (verified in the v0.7.2 snapshot guide, read through a
summarising fetch):

- The subcommands are `create`, `list|ls`, `inspect`, `remove|rm`, `save`,
  `load`, `verify`, `head` and `reindex`.
- `remove` refuses the current group head while other members remain; the user
  must select another head first. `--force` does not bypass this guard.
- `remove` also refuses a snapshot that has indexed children. `--force` exists
  for that case, but its exact semantics are unverified.
- The guide says loaded snapshots and restored children own their required
  files, so removing a base does not break them.

Silo's patch does not change any of this.

**Options.**

1. Call `msb snapshot remove` per member. Silo keeps the dependency policy and
   MicroSandbox keeps storage integrity.
2. Delete snapshot directories directly and run `reindex`. This bypasses the
   upstream guards, so it is rejected.
3. Add a MicroSandbox prune/GC upstream. This is the long-term option, but no
   such command exists in 0.7.2.

**Decision.** Option 1. Never pass `--force`.

- A checkpoint is **pinned** when another Silo checkpoint or a pending
  restore/import journal references it. Pinned checkpoints show "Used by
  {fork}" and cannot be deleted.
- MicroSandbox's children guard is a second line of defence. Silo still
  reports the block in its own words.

**Outline.**

1. `runtime/checkpoints.rs`: add `delete_checkpoint(id, member)` under the VM
   gate:
   - Check pins and head.
   - Move the head with `snapshot head` first if needed.
   - Call `snapshot remove`, then drop the record.
2. `forget_removed` (line 698): remove every member of the group (head last).
3. On capture or import failure, remove the partial member or `silo-import-*`
   group (shared with E-23 and E-24 journaling).
4. Add a startup sweep of unowned `silo-import-*` and `silo-backup-*` groups
   that are older than 24 h.
5. UI: `checkpoint-panel.tsx` Delete action (decision 8, inline two-step);
   add checkpoint storage to the Storage tab.

**Tests.** Unit tests with the existing fake `msb` runner:

- pinned refusal
- head move before removal
- failed-capture cleanup
- sweep ignores owned groups

Also a `mac` live run for storage reclamation.

**Open questions.**

- Should deleting a sandbox also delete its forks' pinned base? The guide
  suggests forks own their files, so yes, but this needs a live check.
- Should "Before restore" and "Fork point" members be auto-collected after N
  days?

## F-02 + F-20: graceful quit on macOS Dock/logout and on Linux logout/shutdown

**Problem.**

- macOS: Dock Quit, logout and any Apple-event quit call `terminate:`. tao has
  no `applicationShouldTerminate:`, so `ExitRequested`, `stop_local_vms` and
  the frontend flush are skipped (F-02).
- Linux: there is no SIGTERM handler and no logind inhibitor (F-20).
- Owner decision 7: confirm on user Quit; never prompt on logout or shutdown,
  but still stop gracefully.

**Upstream status.** The `app_delegate.rs` summary lists `applicationDidFinishLaunching:`,
`applicationWillTerminate:`, `application:openURLs:`, the user-activity pair,
`applicationShouldHandleReopen:hasVisibleWindows:` and
`applicationSupportsSecureRestorableState:`. It does **not** list
`applicationShouldTerminate:` (tao `dev`). An unauthenticated GitHub PR search
for the selector in tao returned no results. That search may be incomplete.

Tauri tracks the gap in these issues (from a GitHub issue search):

- tauri-apps/tauri#9198: "`ExitRequested` not fired on macOS" (open)
- #12978: a feature request for `applicationShouldTerminate(_:)`, closed as a
  duplicate
- #14558: OS-shutdown graceful-exit docs (open)

Upstream has not shipped a fix.

**Options (macOS).**

1. Fork or vendor tao. This is heavy, and tao is pulled transitively through
   tauri-runtime-wry.
2. Local runtime patch: in `setup`, add `applicationShouldTerminate:` to the
   class of `NSApp.delegate()` with `objc2::ffi::class_addMethod`. The delegate
   returns `NSTerminateLater` and routes into the F-03 quit path, which later
   calls `replyToApplicationShouldTerminate:`. Silo already depends on `objc2`.
3. Upstream a tao PR that maps the selector to an `ExitRequested`-style event
   with a deferred reply.

**Decision.** Implement option 2 now and file option 3 in parallel. Remove the
local method once a tao release that Tauri uses carries it.

- Distinguish logout or shutdown from a user Quit through the current Apple
  event's `kAEQuitReason` (`kAELogOut`, `kAEReallyLogOut`, `kAEShowRestartDialog`,
  `kAEShutDown`, …). This is *assumed* from Apple's API; verify it live.
- Logout path: no prompt, bounded `stop_local_vms` (≤ 20 s), then reply YES.
  Reply NO only if the user cancels a Quit.
- Fallback: a bounded `stop_local_vms` on `RunEvent::Exit`.

**Options (Linux).**

- logind `Inhibit("shutdown:sleep", "Silo", "Stopping sandboxes", "delay")`
  over `zbus` (already locked), listening for `PrepareForShutdown(true)`. The
  delay is capped by logind `InhibitDelayMaxSec`, 5 s by default (assumed from
  logind docs).
- SIGTERM via `tokio::signal::unix` routed into the same graceful exit, since
  session logout sends SIGTERM to the app scope.

**Decision.** Use both.

- Take the delay lock at startup and release it after `stop_local_vms`.
- Stop VMs in parallel so the stop fits the 5 s cap.
- Beyond the cap, rely on msb's own VM teardown. This is assumed and needs a
  `linux` test.

**Outline.**

1. New `src-tauri/src/system_shutdown/{macos,linux}.rs` with a
   `ShutdownReason { UserQuit, Logout, Shutdown }` into the F-03 quit request.
2. Unit-test the quit-reason routing.
3. Live checks: `mac` Dock Quit, logout cancel/allow and `osascript quit`;
   `linux` GNOME logout and `systemctl reboot`.

**Open questions.**

- Should Silo raise `InhibitDelayMaxSec` through a packaged logind drop-in
  (Debian package only)?
- Is losing VM state acceptable if logout exceeds the cap?

**Implementation record (F-02, F-20).**

- macOS: `system_shutdown/macos.rs` adds `applicationShouldTerminate:`
  (encoding `Q@:@`) to the class of `NSApp.delegate()` with
  `objc2::ffi::class_addMethod`, between `Builder::build` and `App::run`, then
  assigns the delegate again so AppKit re-reads its optional methods. If a
  future tao already implements the selector, `class_addMethod` fails and Silo
  keeps tao's method. The handler replies `NSTerminateLater`; the Quit path
  answers with `replyToApplicationShouldTerminate:` (YES after VMs stop and
  settings save, NO when the user cancels or Quit fails). No new crate: `objc2`,
  `objc2-foundation` and `objc2-app-kit` were already dependencies. The
  `kAEQuitReason` descriptor is read with `msg_send!`, because the typed
  accessor needs `objc2-core-services`, which is not in the graph.
- Linux: `zbus` 5 (already locked through `ksni` and the single-instance
  plugin) takes a logind `shutdown` delay lock only. Suspend is not inhibited:
  a `sleep` delay lock without handling `PrepareForSleep` would delay every
  suspend and sleeping must not stop sandboxes. The stop budget is
  `InhibitDelayMaxUSec` minus 750 ms (at least 1 s, at most 20 s).
- SIGTERM (Linux logout, `systemctl stop`, `kill`) is handled on both
  platforms with Tokio's `signal` feature (Tokio was already a dependency) and
  enters the same no-prompt path with a 20 s budget.
- Session end never cancels the exit: a failed or late stop is logged and Silo
  exits. `RunEvent::Exit` without an approved Quit (and not an update restart)
  runs a bounded stop as a backstop.
- Gap: `runtime::shutdown::stop_local_vms` (WP-D) still stops VMs one at a
  time, so several running VMs may not all stop inside logind's default 5 s
  delay. Stopping them in parallel is a WP-D follow-up.

## F-09: single instance

**Problem.** A second launch runs `runtime_migration::install`, fails
`remote::start` (C-05) and panics at `.expect("failed to build Silo")`. On
Linux, clicking the launcher while Silo is hidden in the tray does nothing
(`main.rs:214,252-253`).

**Options.**

1. `tauri-plugin-single-instance`: the official plugin.
   - Verified in the plugin guide: it supports Windows, Linux and macOS.
   - On Linux it uses D-Bus (`org.{id}.SingleInstance`).
   - It "must be the first one to be registered".
   - The callback receives `(app, argv, cwd)`.
   - Snap and Flatpak need manifest D-Bus permissions. Silo ships deb and
     AppImage only.
2. A custom lock file or socket in `~/.silo`. Rejected under `AGENTS.md`.

**Decision.** Option 1.

- Register it first on the builder.
- The callback shows, unminimizes and focuses the main window (tray-hidden case
  included).
- Move all migration and `remote::start` work so it runs only after the plugin
  has decided this is the primary instance, inside `setup` after plugin init.
  Nothing mutating runs before `Builder::build`.

**Outline.**

1. `Cargo.toml`: add `tauri-plugin-single-instance = "2"`.
2. `main.rs`:
   - Reorder startup.
   - Replace `.expect` with a logged error dialog.
3. Linux: confirm that the D-Bus session bus exists under AppImage.

**Tests.** Unit-test the startup ordering (migration not called before primary
check). Run `linux` and `mac` double launches.

**Open questions.**

- Debug and release builds use separate identifiers, so both can run at once
  and share `~/.silo`. Should they share one lock? The plugin keys by
  identifier (assumed).
- On macOS the plugin listens on `/tmp/{identifier}_si.sock`. This was
  verified in the plugin source through a summarising fetch.
  - The directory is shared and world-writable.
  - If the socket path is stale or refuses connections, the plugin removes it
    and claims the singleton.
  - Another local user who binds that path first could make Silo exit at
    launch and receive its argv and cwd.
  - Given the single-user Mac target, is this acceptable, or should the macOS
    side be upstreamed or patched to use `$TMPDIR`, which is per user?
    LaunchServices already de-duplicates `open` launches on macOS.

**Implementation record (F-09).**

- Pinned `tauri-plugin-single-instance = "~2.4.5"` (Apache-2.0 OR MIT,
  maintained in `tauri-apps/plugins-workspace`). 2.5.x requires Tauri 2.12;
  Silo pins Tauri 2.11. 2.4.3 moved the macOS listener to a Tokio socket, so
  2.4.5 is the oldest acceptable release. Its dependencies (`zbus` 5, `tokio`,
  `tracing`, `thiserror` 2) were already in `Cargo.lock`.
- Verified in the 2.4.5 source: macOS uses `/tmp/{identifier}_si.sock` and
  exits the second process with `std::process::exit(0)` from the plugin's
  setup; Linux owns `{identifier}.SingleInstance` on the session bus and exits
  the same way. Plugins initialize inside `Builder::build`, before any window
  exists and before Silo's setup hook, so a second launch never reaches
  migration, remote management or VM work.
- Every Silo build (debug, release, deb, AppImage) uses the identifier
  `org.silo.preview`, which answers the first open question: all builds share
  one claim, as the owner requires.
- The plugin sends the second launch's `argv` and `cwd`. The running Silo
  resolves `argv[0]` and compares executable bytes (an AppImage mounts at a new
  path on every launch). A different build shows "Silo is already running.
  Quit it first." in the running Silo, which also comes forward; the plugin
  gives the second process no hook to show it itself.
- The Debian update restart replaces the process with `exec`, which skips the
  plugin's exit cleanup, so Silo releases the D-Bus name first.
- Remaining gaps: the macOS socket stays in the shared `/tmp` (no per-user
  path option in the plugin); another local user can still pre-bind it.
  Upstream a configurable socket directory before relying on it for more than
  a single-user Mac.

## C-02: remote request locking

**Problem.** One process-wide `REQUEST_LOCK` (`remote.rs:22,852`) is held
across every mutating remote request, including gate waits, retry backoff,
desktop setup (up to 2,100 s) and SSH saves. Queued requests outlive the
controller's 600 s deadline, and retries get fresh request IDs, so both the
stale request and the retry execute (C-02; relates to C-27 replay records).

**Options.**

1. Keep the global lock and add a timeout.
2. Use the existing `operation_gate` per-VM/computer scopes for exclusion. Keep
   a short lock only for the replay-record acceptance step.
3. An external job queue or broker. This is overkill for one host process.

**Decision.** Option 2, plus idempotent operation IDs and an execution
deadline.

- The controller sends `operationId`, which stays stable across auto-retries,
  and `startWithinMs`.
- The bridge records `(operationId → accepted | running | done(result))` under
  the short lock, then releases it.
- If the connection has closed or `startWithinMs` has elapsed by the time the
  gate is acquired, the bridge drops the work and records `expired`.
- A retry with a known `operationId` attaches to the existing status instead of
  executing again.

**Outline.**

1. `remote.rs`:
   - Split `dispatch` into accept, which records under the lock, and execute,
     which runs outside it.
   - Add a per-connection liveness flag (bridge stdin EOF).
2. `runtime/remote_ops.rs`: acquire the VM or computer scope with a
   deadline-aware wait.
3. Controller: reuse `operationId` on retry. Bump the protocol `VERSION`
   (C-18/K-23).

**Tests.**

- Two VMs run concurrently.
- Same VM serialises.
- An expired queued request never executes.
- A retry after timeout returns the first result.
- `2pc` concurrent operations.

**Open question.** How long should completed `operationId` results be kept?
The proposal is 1 h in memory, which is lost on app restart.

## C-24: per-sandbox loopback host for published ports

**Problem.** Published ports open at `http://127.0.0.1:PORT`. Cookies are not
port-isolated, so a guest page can read or overwrite non-HttpOnly cookies of
other local services and CSRF them (`network.rs`, `remote_network.rs:254`).

**Options.**

1. Distinct loopback IPs (127.x.y.z).
   - Linux routes all of 127/8 to `lo` (assumed standard).
   - Stock macOS configures only 127.0.0.1, and adding aliases needs root.
     This Mac has extra aliases 127.0.0.10–12 from some other tool, which
     shows they are not a default.
2. `http://<sandbox>-<shortid>.localhost:PORT` while still binding 127.0.0.1.
   - `*.localhost` resolves to loopback per RFC 6761. Modern Chrome and Firefox
     hard-code this (assumed; Safari unverified).
   - Cookies set by the guest are host-only to that name, so they are isolated
     from `127.0.0.1` and `localhost` services.
3. Document the risk only.

**Decision.** Option 2 by default, plus the documentation from option 3.

- CSRF to other loopback services is **not** fixed by any option. Browsers
  treat all these origins as the same local address space. Document this in
  help.
- Keep a "Copy 127.0.0.1 address" fallback for dev servers that reject
  unknown `Host` headers. Some dev servers do; Vite `allowedHosts` behaviour
  for `.localhost` is unverified.

**Outline.**

1. `network.rs` `open_network_port` and `remote_network.rs` build the URL from
   a sanitised DNS label (≤ 63 chars).
2. Frontend shows the same URL.
3. Help text.
4. Unit-test the label sanitising. Run a `mac` check in Safari, Chrome and
   Firefox.

**Open question.** Is Safari support required? If `*.localhost` fails there,
fall back to 127.0.0.1 automatically, or not?

---

## G-04: Unix-socket desktop tunnel

**Problem.** `desktop_viewer.rs:85-118` reserves a TCP port, releases it and
hands it to `ssh -L`. A local process can bind the port first and receive
`Authorization: Basic silo:<password>`. The listener also exposes guest port
6901 to every local user.

**Options.**

1. `ssh -L <0700 dir>/desktop.sock:127.0.0.1:6901` with
   `-o StreamLocalBindUnlink=yes`. The existing `Proxy` then connects with
   `UnixStream`. OpenSSH has supported Unix-socket local forwards since 6.7
   (assumed from OpenSSH release notes).
2. `ssh -W 127.0.0.1:6901` per proxied connection. This means one SSH session
   per HTTP/WebSocket connection, so latency and ControlMaster complexity grow.
3. Keep TCP and verify the peer. Not possible for loopback TCP.

**Decision.** Option 1.

- Put the socket in the existing per-workspace `ssh/desktop-viewer/<ws>`
  directory, which `prepare_private_transport` already creates private (check
  that the mode is 0700).
- Readiness waits for the socket path to exist and accept a connection, and it
  checks that the socket owner is the current uid.

**Outline.**

1. `forward_command` takes a socket path.
2. `Proxy::start` takes a connector trait (TCP for tests, Unix in production).
3. Remove the socket on drop.
4. Remote computers need the same forward on the controller side only; nothing
   changes in the guest.

**Tests.** Unit-test that the proxy forwards over a `UnixListener` fixture and
that a pre-existing foreign socket is refused. Run a `mac` and `linux` desktop
session.

**Open question.** Is any supported controller running an OpenSSH older than
6.7? Unlikely on Ubuntu 24.04 or macOS 14+.

## E-19 / E-20: import safety versus msb extraction guarantees

**Problem.**

- The manifest `runtime_config` is validated but not tied to the config inside
  the snapshot. `msb restore` could therefore apply crafted mounts, patches,
  env, image or init (E-19).
- The untrusted `.tar.zst` goes straight to `msb snapshot load`. Its SHA-256 is
  self-declared, decompressed size is unbounded, and the UI says "Verified
  archive" (E-20).

**What msb 0.7.2 guarantees** (from `archive.rs`, read through a summarising
fetch; confirm line by line before relying on it):

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| Absolute and `..` paths | Rejected ("archive contains unsafe path") |
| Entry types | Checked by `validate_archive_entry_type`. The unpack code carries the comment "Regular / Continuous — the only other types validation lets through", which suggests that symlinks, hardlinks, devices and FIFOs are rejected. The function body was not read. |
| Per-entry blake3 hashes | Checked against the archive's own inventory. The inventory is **self-declared**, with no signature. |
| Aggregate decompressed size or entry count | No limit found |
| Boot overrides | Scope-validated |
| Embedded mounts, env and patches | No validation found |
| `--with-image` OCI layers | No verification found |

**Options.**

1. Trust msb. Rejected, because of the gaps in the table.
2. Pre-scan in Silo with a streaming `tar` + `zstd` reader before `load`, using
   the `tar`/`zstd` crates (assumed not yet direct dependencies). The scan:
   - caps total size (a disk-space-derived limit)
   - caps entry count
   - rejects links, devices and non-regular files. If msb is confirmed to
     reject these already, Silo's check is defence in depth only.
3. Load into an isolated `MSB_HOME` or staging group, inspect the loaded config,
   then promote or discard.
4. Contribute the missing checks upstream: size caps, link rejection, config
   policy hooks.

**Decision.**

- E-20: option 2 now, and option 4 filed upstream. Rename the label to
  "Intact archive".
- E-19: after `snapshot load`, run `snapshot inspect` on the loaded head and
  compare the full restorable config with the validated manifest. Refuse any
  extra mounts, patches, env, image or init.
- Pass every restorable setting explicitly to `msb restore`.
- Add option 3 only if `inspect` does not expose the full config. The v0.7.2
  guide does not document `inspect`'s output fields, so check them against a
  real `msb snapshot inspect` first.

**Outline.**

1. `backup.rs`: add `prescan_archive(path, limits)` before line 601; add an
   inspect-compare after load; clean up the group on refusal (E-23).
2. Rename the label in `backup_controller.rs:329`.

**Tests.** Crafted fixtures:

- symlink entry
- `..` entry
- 10 GB zero-bomb with a small compressed size
- manifest/config mismatch with an added mount
- extra env

**Open questions.**

- Should imports from other people be allowed at all, or should the UI warn
  "only import files you created"?
- Should the image be re-pulled by digest instead of trusting `--with-image`?

**Implementation findings (2026-09-30, WP-E engine).** Read line by line in
the pinned source (`microsandbox-60d4dc8…`), not through a summary:

- `validate_archive_entry_type` (`sdk/rust/lib/backend/local/snapshot/archive.rs`)
  allows only regular, contiguous, GNU sparse and directory entries; GNU
  long names are handled separately and PAX headers are rejected. The table
  above is therefore confirmed. There is still no size or entry-count limit.
- `msb snapshot inspect` prints key/value text (image, scope, root disk,
  parent, labels) without owned volumes or extensions, so it cannot be
  compared with a manifest. The comparison reads the loaded member's
  `snapshot.json` instead (the file `inspect` reads), found through
  `snapshot list --format json` and confined to the native store.
- That descriptor (`packages/microsandbox-types/rust/lib/snapshot/manifest.rs`,
  `deny_unknown_fields`) is the full restorable configuration of a snapshot:
  image reference and digest, root layout, owned volumes, default user and,
  for a full checkpoint, CPU/memory geometry. It has no env, patch, init,
  rlimit or host-mount fields, and `msb restore` binds host resources only
  through explicit flags, which Silo never passes. Passing every setting to
  `msb restore` (option 3) is therefore unnecessary.
- `backup.rs` pre-scans the selected payload with the `tar` and `zstd`
  crates (both already in `Cargo.lock`) in the same read that hashes and
  extracts it: allowed entry types as above, relative normal UTF-8 paths, no
  PAX or long-link headers, at most 262 144 entries, a decompressed-byte
  budget equal to the runtime store's free space less 1 GiB (and less the
  staged copy on a shared volume), and sparse entries no larger than the
  sandbox's largest declared disk.
- Filing the missing caps upstream (option 4) needs an owner with
  MicroSandbox access; it is not done.
- State exports stop at 128 `silo-backup-*` captures per source group. This
  bounds hidden export members without violating the owner's no-automatic-
  deletion decision. The pinned `lineage.rs` commits each successful capture
  as the next capture's parent, so deleting a completed export capture can
  break later checkpoints. Existing checkpoint exports remain available at
  the cap. The cap is conservative product policy; changing it needs no
  archive migration.
- E-25 export preflight estimates sparse file data from allocated blocks
  in source disks, native snapshots and the image cache, with headers and
  compression overhead. The pinned `archive.rs::save_snapshot` includes
  the parent chain and image-cache files. The estimate includes unrelated
  native data conservatively, sums copies sharing a volume, and leaves
  1 GiB free. It is advisory because sources and free space can change;
  the destination is rechecked with the actual saved payload sizes.

## B-05: GitHub permission allowlists for sandbox and host-push tokens

**Problem.** Write mode copies every installation permission, including
`administration`, `secrets`, `workflows`, `repository_hooks`, `actions` and
`environments`. Read mode includes secret-bearing scopes
(`github_tokens.rs:199-221`). Owner decision 1 requires host push to use
`contents: write` only.

**Options.**

1. Denylist.
2. An explicit allowlist, down-scoped per token. Verified in the GitHub REST
   docs for "Create an installation access token for an app":
   - The `permissions` body parameter only down-scopes. A token "cannot be
     granted permissions that the app was not granted".
   - `repositories` and `repository_ids` restrict the token to named
     repositories.

**Decision.** Option 2, using three constant allowlists in `github_tokens.rs`,
each intersected with what the installation grants:

| Token | Permissions |
|---|---|
| Sandbox read | `metadata:read`, `contents:read`, `issues:read`, `pull_requests:read`, `statuses:read`, `checks:read` |
| Sandbox write | read set plus `contents`, `issues`, `pull_requests` and `statuses` at `write` |
| Host push | `contents:write` and `metadata:read` only. Restrict it with `repositories` to the single bound repository, then revoke it after the push (decision 1). The revoke endpoint `DELETE /installation/token` is assumed; it was not re-fetched. |

Never grant `administration`, `secrets`, `dependabot_secrets`,
`codespaces_secrets`, `environments`, `repository_hooks`,
`secret_scanning_alerts`, `security_events` or `actions:write`.

**Outline.**

1. Replace the copy loop with `allowlist.intersect(installation)`.
2. Keep the existing unsupported-permission refusal.
3. Unit-test that each mode never contains a denied scope, and run a `gh` live
   push.

**Open questions.**

- Should sandbox write include `workflows:write`? Without it, agents cannot
  push `.github/workflows` changes.
- Should sandbox read include `actions:read` (CI logs)?

## K-23: typed error codes across the native bridge

**Problem.** Errors cross the Tauri bridge as English strings that both sides
match by text (D-17, E-42, H-31, C-18, `production-source.ts:279,469,525`).
Copy changes (decision 10) will break these matches.

**Options.**

1. Tauri's documented pattern: commands return any `Serialize` error, for
   example a `thiserror` enum (already in the dependency graph). This is
   assumed from the Tauri docs.
2. `tauri-specta` for generated TS bindings. It is still RC; adopting it now is
   a large migration.
3. A string prefix convention. Fragile.

**Decision.** Option 1 with a minimal shape:

```rust
struct BridgeError {
    code: ErrorCode,
    message: String,
}
```

- `ErrorCode` is a closed `snake_case` enum: `update_in_progress`,
  `unsupported_remote_operation`, `cancelled`, `already_queued`, `busy`,
  `not_found`, `internal`.
- Keep `From<String>` mapping to `internal` so packages can migrate one at a
  time.
- The remote protocol carries the same `code` field.
- The TS side gets a hand-written union type plus a test that it matches the
  Rust enum.
- Revisit specta after 1.0 of tauri-specta.

**Outline.**

1. `src-tauri/src/bridge_error.rs`.
2. `contracts/bridge-error.ts`.
3. Migrate the five matched sites first.
4. Tests: serialisation round-trip, and a test that fails if a TS code is
   missing from Rust.

**Open question.** None blocking.

## K-24: mutex poison policy

**Problem.** `operation_gate` recovers from poisoning with `into_inner`, but
`remote.rs` `CONFIG_LOCK`/`REQUEST_LOCK`, `secrets.rs:15-16`, `github.rs:23,26`,
`network.rs:15` and `editor.rs:18` turn one panic into permanent errors, and
`try_lock` `update_guard`s then block updates forever (B-45, C-25, G-23).

**Options.**

1. `parking_lot::Mutex`, which has no poisoning and is already locked at
   0.12.5. It hides the signal entirely.
2. A std helper `lock_or_recover(&m, name)` that logs once and returns
   `into_inner()`.
3. Leave it per-site. This is the current inconsistency.

**Decision.** Option 2 with a rule:

- **Recover** for `Mutex<()>` serialisation locks and for caches rebuilt from
  disk.
- **Recover and reload** for guards of state persisted to disk (secrets, GitHub
  state, config): after recovery, re-read the file before use.
- Never keep an in-memory invariant across a panic.
- `update_guard` must use `lock_or_recover` semantics instead of treating
  `WouldBlock` from a poisoned lock as busy.
- Replace panicking `unwrap`s under locks (`secrets.rs:415`).

**Outline.**

1. `src-tauri/src/sync.rs` helper, applied by the owning packages.
2. Tests: poison a lock in a test thread and assert that the next call
   succeeds and reloads.

**Open question.** Is parking_lot acceptable instead? It is simpler, but it
loses the log line that a panic happened under a lock.

## Owner answers (2026-09-29)

- **E-03 automatic cleanup:** no. Checkpoints (including "Before restore" and
  "Fork point") are removed only by an explicit Delete checkpoint action or
  when their sandbox is deleted.
- **C-24 published-port hosts:** `*.localhost` addresses are acceptable and
  Safari must work. Verify Safari resolution in the macOS live session; if
  Safari cannot open `*.localhost`, fall back to `127.0.0.1` for Safari.
- **E-19/E-20 foreign export files:** importing export files made by other
  people is allowed (no blocking warning). The import safety checks (size and
  entry caps, manifest-versus-snapshot config comparison, "Intact archive"
  wording) still apply.
- **D-02 busy rows:** a sandbox with an operation running keeps its last known
  state next to its existing operation label ("Starting…", "Creating
  checkpoint…"); no extra spinner. Other sandboxes keep updating normally.
- **B-05 workflow and CI permissions:** no separate opt-in. When "Allow GitHub
  changes" is on, the sandbox token also includes `workflows: write` and
  `actions: read`; when it is off, neither is granted. The rest of B-05
  (dropping admin and secret-bearing scopes) is unchanged.
- **F-09 single instance:** only one Silo of any kind runs at a time, including
  development builds next to the installed app. A second launch focuses the
  running Silo, or, when the running one is a different build, shows "Silo is
  already running. Quit it first." instead of crashing.
