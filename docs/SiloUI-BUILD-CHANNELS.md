# Build channels: production and development

Only two Silo builds exist, and they never share state.

| | Production | Development |
|---|---|---|
| Identifier | `org.silo.preview` | `org.silo.dev` |
| Product name | Silo | Silo Dev |
| Built by | `desktop:build`, the release workflows, installed packages | `npm run desktop` (`tauri dev`), `npm run desktop:build:debug`, any `--debug` build |
| Configuration | `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` | `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` merged with `src-tauri/tauri.dev.conf.json` |
| Updates | Release feed | None. Silo Dev never updates itself or installs a production release |

`scripts/build_desktop.py` adds the development configuration whenever `--debug`
(or `-d`) is passed and never otherwise. The previous `tauri.debug.conf.json` was
folded into `tauri.dev.conf.json` (ad-hoc signing included), so there is no third
identity. A production identifier, path, or name must never change: existing
users' data lives there.

## One source of truth

`src-tauri/src/channel.rs` derives every device-visible name from the bundle
identifier embedded in the running binary (`channel::init` runs first in `main`,
including for the `--remote-bridge`, `--remote-guest` and editor-transport modes
that run without a window). Only the exact production identifier selects
production; any other identifier is treated as development, so a stray build can
never touch production data. Unit tests pin every production name to its released
value and require every development name to differ.

Development and packaging scripts read this API through the standalone
`scripts/channel_names.rs` exporter. The Python adapter compiles it in a temporary
directory, reads its JSON output, and deletes the executable; the Node adapter
uses the same Python adapter. This requires Rust and Python 3.11 or newer but no
Tauri build, GitHub configuration, or access to application state. It avoids a
second registry of names or a parser tied to Rust source formatting. Linux
verification harnesses use the same adapter for runtime aliases, including
non-production identifiers, so Dev fixtures look under the Dev private home. Production app bundle roots, disk-image volume names, release asset names and
package identity checks also read the exporter; production output names stay
unchanged. Static Tauri
configuration and documentation examples remain pinned by channel tests.

## Shared state that is now per channel

| State | Production (unchanged) | Development |
|---|---|---|
| App data, config, cache, logs, WebView storage | `<app dirs>/org.silo.preview` | `<app dirs>/org.silo.dev` (Tauri keys these by identifier) |
| Runtime alias dirs `~/.silo/<hash>` | hash of production storage | `~/.silo-dev/<hash>` |
| Silo private home `~/.silo` (editor workspace files, desktop sockets, Connections state `desktop-remote/`, control socket) | `~/.silo` | `~/.silo-dev` |
| Keychain: GitHub (`account`, `personal-token`, `runtime-grants`) | `org.silo.Silo.github` | `org.silo.dev.github` |
| Keychain: secret values | `org.silo.Silo.secrets` | `org.silo.dev.secrets` |
| Connections bridge link | `~/.local/bin/silo-remote` | `~/.local/bin/silo-remote-dev` |
| Forced command in an installed remote key | `exec ~/.local/bin/silo-remote --remote-bridge` | `exec ~/.local/bin/silo-remote-dev --remote-bridge` |
| Remote key comment | `Silo remote management` | `Silo Dev remote management` |
| SSH aliases for computers on other devices | `silo-remote-<device>-<computer>` | `silo-dev-remote-<device>-<computer>` |
| SSH config/known_hosts/keys | under the private homes above | under `~/.silo-dev` |
| `~/.ssh/config` | one `Include` line per private home, so each channel adds its own line | |
| Native app menus, dialogs, tray labels and shutdown inhibitor | `Silo` | `Silo Dev` |
| VS Code profile | `Silo` | `Silo Dev` |
| Linux autostart entry and desktop id | `org.silo.preview.desktop` ("Silo Preview") | `org.silo.dev.desktop` ("Silo Dev") |
| Linux tray id, notification desktop entry | `org.silo.preview`, `Silo` | `org.silo.dev`, `Silo Dev` |
| macOS login item, notification permission, single-instance lock | keyed by bundle identifier | keyed by bundle identifier (verified: the plugin's socket and D-Bus name include it) |
| Updater | release feed | disabled |

Left shared on purpose: the `.silo-backup` archive format (so Dev can import
Production exports), `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on a device being managed (keys
are matched by blob), the user's own VS Code/Zed installs, and `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.

Unit tests and the isolation rules assume both channels can run at the same time
on one device; they cannot collide on a socket, lock, link, key, or service name.

## Connections and identity

Silo Dev always has its own Connections identity: its own device id, control
socket, and Connections switch (off by default). Devices that Dev
manages, and devices that manage Dev, see it as a separate device.

- Dev as the managed device: enabling Connections links
  `~/.local/bin/silo-remote-dev`. A production Silo on another device cannot
  reach it, because installed keys only run the production bridge. Use a Dev build
  on the controlling side.
- Dev as the controller with its own key: Dev installs `Silo Dev remote management`
  keys whose forced command is the dev bridge, so the remote device needs Silo Dev.
- Dev as the controller with the key copied from production (see below): the key's
  existing authorized_keys entry on the remote device runs the production bridge
  there, so Dev reaches the production Silo on that device without any re-setup.
  Driving or changing computers on a remote production Silo is still production
  state; automation and tests must not do it.

## Copying production configuration into Dev

```sh
npm --prefix app/SiloUI run dev:import-production-settings -- --dry-run
npm --prefix app/SiloUI run dev:import-production-settings
```

One-time and explicit. Production is only read; the command refuses to run while
Silo Dev is running, lists what it will copy, and asks before replacing anything
Dev already has (previous files are kept as `*.bak-<time>`). Re-running is safe.
Values are never printed.

Production data may use the saved-data names from before the computer vocabulary
or the current ones; the importer reads both and always writes the current names.
It also removes Dev's `vocabulary-migration.json` record, so the one-time saved-data
conversion (see the documentation of `runtime_migration/vocabulary.rs`) runs again
at Dev's next launch. The conversion does nothing to data that already uses the
current names.

The importer rejects symlinks at Dev channel roots and within destination paths,
including dangling links, before applying any file or Keychain copy. It repeats
the check after confirmation. [Node's `lstatSync`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v24.x/api/fs.html#fslstatsyncpath-options)
inspects the link itself instead of its target. Temporary-home regressions cover
linked channel directories, nested remote directories, files, and links created
while confirmation is open.

Imported private files and their backups use `0600`, including when the previous
Dev file had broader permissions. Backups use the same atomic writer as imports:
[Node's file writer](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v24.x/api/fs.html#fswritefilesyncfile-data-options)
accepts creation permissions, while
[the copy API's mode](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v24.x/api/fs.html#fscopyfilesyncsrc-dest-mode)
controls copy flags rather than permissions. Public SSH keys use `0644`.
The writer sets final permissions and
[syncs the open file](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v24.x/api/fs.html#fsfsyncsyncfd)
before rename, then syncs the containing directory before continuing. Directory
sync is required separately by the [Linux fsync contract](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fsync.2.html).
Failures close descriptors and remove partial private staging files. Fixture
tests inject partial writes and file/directory sync failures using temporary
HOMEs and an in-memory Keychain; they never run the importer against live data.

Copied:

- App preferences and onboarding completion: theme, reduce motion, notification
  settings, terminal/editor/browser choices (`settings.json`, allow-list only).
- GitHub personal access token (Keychain duplicate under `org.silo.dev.github`).
  The OAuth login is not copied unless `--include-github-oauth` is given: GitHub
  rotates refresh tokens, so whichever channel refreshes first invalidates the
  other's copy and logs it out. Connect GitHub in Dev instead, or accept that risk.
- Secret definitions and values (Keychain duplicate), with no computer assignments,
  pending work, errors, or activity.
- Devices: the saved list and the client key (`id_ed25519`, `.pub`) that
  reaches them. Dev keeps or creates its own device id and leaves Connections off.

Never copied: computers, checkpoints, disks, volumes, backups and history, the
MicroSandbox home and runtime, per-computer network/SSH settings, startup-computer and
launch-at-login choices, update preferences, derived SSH configs, `~/.ssh`, VS Code
profiles. Dev recreates editor and SSH integration on first use.

macOS uses the `security` tool: the Keychain may ask you to allow access to the
production items, and Dev asks once before reading items the tool created. Linux
uses `secret-tool` (not exercised against a live secret service here).

## Running both

Launch the exact bundle you mean (`Silo.app` or `Silo Dev.app`). Close Dev before
running the import. Clean up dev-only files by deleting `<app dirs>/org.silo.dev`,
`~/.silo-dev`, `~/.local/bin/silo-remote-dev`, the `org.silo.dev.*` Keychain items,
the `Silo Dev` VS Code profile, and the `Include ~/.silo-dev/...` lines in `~/.ssh/config`.
