//! One-time conversion of saved data to the current vocabulary: what Silo calls a
//! *computer* (earlier *workspace*, *machine* and *sandbox*), a *device* (earlier *host*)
//! and a *connection* (earlier *remote management*). It runs once per channel at the first
//! launch after the update, before anything reads the converted files, so the normal code
//! reads only the current names. The converters here are the only code that still knows
//! the earlier ones. See `docs/SiloUI-VOCABULARY.md`.
//!
//! # What is converted
//!
//! Application settings (`appconfig/`):
//!
//! | File | Change |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | `settings.json` | settings `startWorkspacesAtLaunch`, `startupWorkspaceIds`, `sandboxOrder` become `startComputersAtLaunch`, `startupComputerIds`, `computerOrder`; in `onboardingDraft`: `machines`, `unfinishedMachineEditor`, `workspaceSelections`, `workspaceIdentities`, `workspaceRepositoryAccess` become `computers`, `unfinishedComputerEditor`, `computerSelections`, `computerIdentities`, `computerRepositoryAccess`; `currentStep` `"workspaces"` becomes `"computers"`; configurations lose `kind` and their `desktop.startWithSandbox` becomes `startWithComputer`; SSH configurations (`kind: "ssh"`), an unfinished SSH editor and the draft entries keyed by an SSH configuration are dropped |
//!
//! Application data (`appdata/`):
//!
//! | File | Change |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | `github.json` | `workspaces` becomes `computers`; `workspace` becomes `computer` in its entries and in `operations` |
//! | `secrets.json` | `secrets[].workspaces`, `secrets[].pendingWorkspaces` become `computers`, `pendingComputers`; `pendingRevocations[].workspace` becomes `computer` |
//! | `backup-operation.json` | `archive.sandboxes` and `request.machines` become `computers`; `request.pending_capture.workspaceId` becomes `computerId` |
//!
//! The storage generation Silo reads (the selected one, or `runtime/` before any is selected):
//!
//! | File | Change |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | `machines.json` | becomes `computers.json`; `machines` becomes `computers`; entries lose `kind`, SSH entries are dropped, `desktop.startWithSandbox` becomes `startWithComputer` |
//! | `sandbox-activity.json` | becomes `computer-activity.json`; `workspace` becomes `computer`, `machineId` becomes `computerId` |
//! | `setup-activity.json` | `workspace` becomes `computer`; `phase` `"workspaces"` becomes `"computers"`; steps `workspace-configuration`, `-verification`, `-removal`, `-disk-preparation`, `-image-preparation`, `-image-import`, `-runtime-preparation`, `-settings`, `-image-wait` become `computer-...` |
//! | `checkpoints/<id>.json` | `pendingCheckpointRestore.sourceWorkspace` becomes `sourceComputer` |
//! | `lifecycle-operations/*.json` | `machine_id` becomes `computer_id`; the embedded `event` is converted like an activity record |
//! | `update-resume.json` | `machines` becomes `computers` |
//! | `configuration-operation.json` | `previous` and `request` are converted like `machines.json` |
//! | `network.json` | `mappings[].workspace` becomes `computer` |
//! | `ssh-access.json` | `workspace` becomes `computer`, `machineId` becomes `computerId` |
//! | `microsandbox/repository-push-operations.json` | `operation.workspace` becomes `computer` |
//!
//! The private state folder (`~/.silo` or `~/.silo-dev`, from `channel.rs`):
//!
//! | File | Change |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | `desktop-remote/config.json` | `hostId` becomes `deviceId`, `hosts` becomes `devices` |
//!
//! Left as they are: MicroSandbox's own data and labels, Keychain items, the `/workspace`
//! storage files, names and identifiers that keep their older wording on purpose, and
//! values that hold a computer's name or identifier.
//!
//! # Which storage is converted
//!
//! Only storage the normal runtime reads is converted in place:
//!
//! * a selected generation (`runtime-generation.json`): the converted or clean folder;
//! * `runtime/` when no generation is selected and the storage migration does not need to
//!   run (`not-required`, or no record and no computer to convert).
//!
//! `runtime/` is left byte for byte as it was whenever the storage migration still has to
//! convert it, and once a generation is selected, because it is then the pre-upgrade
//! backup that `pre_upgrade_backup` keeps for 14 days and measures, reveals or deletes as a
//! whole. Because the storage migration copies that folder, the copy it stages is
//! converted with [`convert_storage_directory`] before anything reads it, and a clean
//! generation left by an interrupted attempt is converted the same way. The storage
//! migration reads the previous generation's inventory only through
//! [`read_previous_computers`], which accepts both file names and both vocabularies, so the
//! old format is read nowhere else.
//!
//! # Crash safety and failure
//!
//! Each file is written to a temporary file in its folder, synced, renamed over the
//! original and followed by a folder sync, so a file is either wholly old or wholly new. A
//! renamed file (`machines.json`, `sandbox-activity.json`) is written under its new name
//! before the old one is removed; if both exist the old one is converted again and wins,
//! as the only build that writes it is the older one. Files that already use the current
//! names are not rewritten. The record `vocabulary-migration.json` is written last, after
//! every file, so an interrupted run converts what is left at the next launch and a file
//! converted before the interruption is left alone.
//!
//! A file that is not valid JSON or has a structure no build wrote is carried over
//! unchanged (a renamed file keeps its bytes under the new name): the normal code treats it
//! exactly as the earlier code did. A file that exists but cannot be converted safely (a
//! link, a pipe, larger than any build writes), a file that cannot be read or written, a
//! storage selection or migration record that cannot be read, and a channel folder that is
//! a link or lies behind one stop the migration before anything is changed or the record is
//! saved: skipping them would leave the converted code without data it expects. Silo then
//! does not start, explains why, and converts the rest at the next launch.
