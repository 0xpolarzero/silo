//! The previous runtime generation, kept as a pre-upgrade backup after a migration that
//! converted every computer, and deleted 14 days later or when the user asks.
//!
//! `<app_data>/runtime` is that backup only while the migration is complete and the
//! converted generation is selected (`runtime_migration::previous_generation_is_backup`).
//! After "Continue" the same folder holds the only copy of the unconverted computers, so
//! nothing here offers, measures, reveals or deletes it then.
//!
//! The 14-day window is recorded in `pre-upgrade-backup.json`, not in
//! `runtime-migration.json`, whose reader rejects unknown fields: builds without this
//! feature never read the new file, and this build reads an install that migrated earlier
//! (no record) as a window starting at its first launch. Without a readable record the
//! backup is still shown and can be deleted by hand, but is never deleted automatically.
//!
//! The folder may also hold `before-checkpoints-backup-history.json`, which the migration moved
//! there so the old export-folder choice is not replayed against the new runtime, and
//! `before-checkpoints-backup-operation.json` when an earlier build moved the export journal
//! there too. A migration that converts every computer moves no journal into it now: one that
//! recorded its result, or whose cleanup only the runtime can do and so waits for the upgrade,
//! stays in the app data folder for the converted storage's recovery to report or finish (the
//! backup keeps its copy of what the operation left, untouched), and one that cannot be read is
//! set aside there as `backup-operation.unreadable-<UTC date>.json`. Only "Continue" moves an
//! unfinished journal into the previous folder, which is not a backup then. Nothing reads the
//! moved files back, so deleting the folder loses nothing the app uses.
//!
//! The previous generation was also reached through an alias symlink in the account's state
//! directory (`runtime::runtime_home_alias`), which dangles once the folder is gone. It is
//! removed with the folder, and later if the folder was deleted by hand, but only when it is a
//! symlink whose link text is exactly the backup's `microsandbox` directory.
