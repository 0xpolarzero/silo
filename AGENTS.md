## Silo: driving and debugging

This repository includes a native macOS status-bar app at `app/Silo`. Use the
commands and evidence workflow below whenever you change or investigate the app.
Run commands from the repository root unless a command says otherwise.

### Scope and current implementation

- The local app bundle is `app/Silo/build/Silo.app`.
- The app is a regular macOS application with a normal `Silo` application
  menu and Dock/Cmd-Tab presence. The Descent status item and transient popover
  provide quick actions. One unified `Silo` window uses top tabs for
  Overview, Workspaces, GitHub, Notifications, Backup, and General. Setup is a
  first-run or explicitly requested repair flow, not permanent navigation.
- The source of truth is `app/Silo/Sources/`, especially
  `SiloApp.swift`, `StatusBarController.swift`, `MonitorView.swift`,
  `SettingsView.swift`, `DetailView.swift`, and `AppModel.swift`.
- UI-test workspace values are deterministic fixtures, not live sandbox
  telemetry. Production state comes through the typed Silo app protocol.
- Generated bundles, DerivedData, test results, and logs are under
  `app/Silo/build/`. The app-local `.gitignore` ignores that directory;
  never commit generated artifacts.

### Host prerequisites

- Use an Apple Silicon Mac with the macOS SDK required by the project and a
  full Xcode installation, not only command-line tools.
- UI smoke testing requires a logged-in interactive GUI session with an
  available menu bar; it is not a headless or SSH-only check.
- No `silo`/MicroSandbox VM, GitHub credential, or running workspace is required
  by the current static app. Do not seed credentials or live sandbox data just
  to drive this fixture UI.
- When diagnosing a toolchain issue, use these non-destructive checks:

```bash
xcodebuild -version
xcodebuild -showsdks
xcodebuild -project app/Silo/Silo.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Silo -showdestinations
```

The scripts select the runnable macOS arm64 host destination. Do not hard-code
the machine-specific destination identifier from `-showdestinations`.


### Build and test order

After changing app source, rebuild the bundle before running the UI smoke test.
The scripts use `/bin/zsh`; invoke them as executable scripts rather than with
`bash`:

```bash
app/Silo/Scripts/build.sh
```

This produces a locally ad-hoc signed arm64 Debug bundle at
`app/Silo/build/Silo.app` and writes
`app/Silo/build/logs/build.log`.

Run the model/unit tests separately:

```bash
app/Silo/Scripts/test.sh
```

This writes `app/Silo/build/logs/test.log` and runs only the
`SiloTests` target. It does not update the bundle at
`app/Silo/build/Silo.app`.

For runtime/configuration installation progress inside the first onboarding
step and its disabled Continue gate, run only the focused startup flow:

```bash
app/Silo/Scripts/smoke-test.sh --startup-only
```

Run the real macOS accessibility/UI flow. For status-item and popover-only
changes, use the focused flow so onboarding is not replayed:

```bash
app/Silo/Scripts/smoke-test.sh --monitor-only
```

For the centralized runtime-repair warning, dedicated repair action, and
verified-state cutover across the status item, popover, and unified-window tabs, use:

```bash
app/Silo/Scripts/smoke-test.sh --repair-only
```

For the status-popover folder browser, run only its Finder-style interaction:

```bash
app/Silo/Scripts/smoke-test.sh --picker-only
```

For terminal/editor preference changes, run only the settings-to-status flow:

```bash
app/Silo/Scripts/smoke-test.sh --preferences-only
```

For unified top-tab and workspace navigation changes, use:

```bash
app/Silo/Scripts/smoke-test.sh --navigation-only
```

For unified-window lifecycle confirmation ownership and restart verification, use:

```bash
app/Silo/Scripts/smoke-test.sh --lifecycle-only
```

For backup destination preview semantics, use:

```bash
app/Silo/Scripts/smoke-test.sh --backup-only
```

For consolidated running, success, partial-restart, and failure backup results,
use:

```bash
app/Silo/Scripts/smoke-test.sh --backup-result-only
```

For operation-failure presentation and error-detail routing, use:

```bash
app/Silo/Scripts/smoke-test.sh --failure-only
```

Run the complete onboarding and GitHub fixture suite only when those surfaces or
their shared infrastructure change:

```bash
app/Silo/Scripts/smoke-test.sh
```

Both modes clear and recreate `build/DerivedData/Smoke` and
`build/SmokeProducts`, then write complete xcodebuild/XCTest output to
`app/Silo/build/logs/smoke-ui.log`. The UI test launches the bundle at
`build/Silo.app`, not the newly built dependency under `SmokeProducts`;
therefore running `build.sh` first is mandatory after source changes. The script
exits non-zero unless the log contains `** TEST SUCCEEDED **`.

For status-item and popover work, the normal verification sequence is:

```bash
app/Silo/Scripts/build.sh
app/Silo/Scripts/test.sh
app/Silo/Scripts/smoke-test.sh --monitor-only
```

Do not run two smoke tests concurrently: each invocation removes the shared
`DerivedData/Smoke` and `SmokeProducts` directories.

### Launching and driving the app

Gracefully close an existing instance before launching with different arguments:

```bash
osascript -e 'tell application id "org.silo.Silo" to quit' \
  2>/dev/null || true
open app/Silo/build/Silo.app
pgrep -x Silo
```

Normal production launch creates the application menu and status item but does not
automatically open the monitor popover after setup. On first launch it may open
the setup window. Otherwise click the Silo Descent mark in the menu bar to open the
monitor. Do not use the absence of a monitor popover or `app.windows` as a
launch-failure signal; the monitor remains primarily a status-item/popover app.

For deterministic automation and debugging, launch the test mode:

```bash
osascript -e 'tell application id "org.silo.Silo" to quit' \
  2>/dev/null || true
open app/Silo/build/Silo.app --args --ui-test-open-popover
```

`--ui-test-open-popover` is an intentional test-only argument. The app waits
briefly and opens the popover during launch. In this mode the popover uses
`NSPopover.Behavior.applicationDefined` so XCUITest app activation cannot dismiss
it mid-assertion. Production mode remains `.transient`; do not use test mode to
judge normal outside-click dismissal behavior.
The checked-in UI test supplies this argument through `XCUIApplication(url:)`;
manual `open` is a targeted diagnosis path, not a replacement for the smoke
test's accessibility assertions.

The canonical UI driver is `app/Silo/UITests/SiloUITests.swift`.
Use accessibility identifiers rather than screen coordinates:

| Identifier | Element | Expected value/action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `statusItem.button` | status item | Accessibility label `Silo` |
| `monitor.popover` | popover hosting view | Popover content root |
| `monitor.title` | title text | `Silo` |
| `workspace.dev.name` / `.state` | dev row | `dev` / `Stopped` |
| `workspace.playgrounds.name` / `.state` | playgrounds row | `playgrounds` / `Stopped` |
| `workspace.personal.name` / `.state` | personal row | `personal` / `Stopped` |
| `open-monitor.button` | Unified-window shortcut | Opens the Overview top tab |
| `quit.button` | Quit button | Terminates the app |
| `settings.tabs` | Unified window | Hosts all top-level destinations |
| `runtime-repair.window.banner` / `.message` / `.action` | Global repair banner | One banner with `Silo installation needs repair` and one `Repair…` action on every top tab |
| `runtime-repair.status-item.warning` | Status warning state | Status item value communicates repair while its label remains `Silo` |
| `runtime-repair.popover.row` / `.message` / `.action` | Popover repair row | One compact repair row and one `Repair…` action |
| `workspace.section-picker` / `workspace.section.<name>` | Workspace tools | Switches Summary, Files, Logs, Network, Repositories, and Maintenance |
| `folders.path-bar` / `folders.search.field` | Folder scope and search | Clickable `/workspace` breadcrumbs and bounded search |
| `folders.tree` / `folders.entry.<safe-path>.expand` | Lazy folder tree | Selects, expands, or double-clicks a real VM directory |
| `folders.open.button` | Editor handoff | Opens the exact selected folder in the resolved editor adapter |
| `settings.applications.terminal.picker` / `.editor.picker` | App-specific launch preferences | Defaults to the discovered macOS app and allows a supported override |
| `workspace.<id>.open-terminal` / `.open-editor-shortcut` / `.open-editor` | Dynamic app actions | Direct terminal/editor shortcuts and the action menu use the resolved app override |

The Quit button defines the `Command-Q` keyboard shortcut. Prefer semantic UI
queries and waits over fixed sleeps or pixel coordinates. The test intentionally
checks the status item, compact popover, all three workspace rows, shortcuts,
absence of refresh/counter UI, and clean termination.

### Capturing complete evidence

The three script logs have different purposes:

```text
app/Silo/build/logs/build.log      compiler/linker/bundle output
app/Silo/build/logs/test.log       unit-test output
app/Silo/build/logs/smoke-ui.log   full UI-test and xcodebuild output
```

Unit-test result bundles are under
`app/Silo/build/DerivedData/Tests/Logs/Test/`; UI-smoke result bundles
are under `app/Silo/build/DerivedData/Smoke/Logs/Test/`. Use the exact
path printed by the corresponding run.

The smoke log ends with the exact `.xcresult` path. Set that path explicitly
when inspecting a run:

```bash
RESULT='app/Silo/build/DerivedData/Smoke/Logs/Test/<run>.xcresult'

xcrun xcresulttool get test-results summary --path "$RESULT"
xcrun xcresulttool get test-results tests --path "$RESULT"
xcrun xcresulttool get test-results activities \
  --path "$RESULT" \
  --test-id 'SiloUITests/testStatusItemMinimalPopoverAndQuit()' \
  --compact
```

Export failure screenshots or other attachments into the ignored build tree:

```bash
xcrun xcresulttool export attachments \
  --path "$RESULT" \
  --output-path app/Silo/build/xcresult-attachments \
  --only-failures
```

XCTest output is not the same as the app's unified log. Query the app process
separately after a run:

```bash
log show --last 3m --style compact --info --debug \
  --predicate 'process == "Silo"'

log show --last 3m --style compact --info --debug \
  --predicate 'process == "Silo" AND (messageType == error OR messageType == fault)'
```

For a live launch/interaction trace, start this before driving the app and stop
it with `Ctrl-C`:

```bash
log stream --timeout 10m --style compact --level debug \
  --predicate 'process == "Silo"'
```

Keep this stream in the foreground when possible. If a capture is required,
write it to a private temporary path outside the repository (for example
`/tmp/Silo-runtime.log`), remove it after analysis, and never paste raw
unified logs into public posts or commit them. Correlate log timestamps with
`smoke-ui.log`. AppKit, AppIntents, XCTest, TCC, and other
system messages can be noisy; classify them by subsystem and do not treat every
`Error` line as an app failure. The app currently has no intentional
application-level logger, so unified logs mostly describe framework behavior.

If the process actually terminates unexpectedly, inspect only the crash report
associated with that reproduction under
`~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/` and keep it local. Do not bulk-print or
copy the diagnostic-report directory; crash reports can contain private paths
and environment details.

### Debugging hangs, launch failures, and crashes

Use a verified process identity before attaching tools:

```bash
pgrep -x Silo
```

For a responsive-process snapshot:

```bash
sample <verified-pid> 5 1
```

For an interactive debugger, launch the actual executable rather than a stale
test product:

```bash
lldb -- app/Silo/build/Silo.app/Contents/MacOS/Silo
```

Useful LLDB commands:

```text
settings set target.run-args -- --ui-test-open-popover
breakpoint set --selector togglePopover
run
bt
thread backtrace all
```

To attach instead, use `lldb -p <verified-pid>` only after confirming the PID
with `pgrep -x`. Prefer graceful termination through `osascript` after
debugging; do not use `kill -9` as a first response because it bypasses normal
popover and status-item cleanup.

Check the symptom against the narrowest evidence source:

| Symptom | First checks |
| --- | --- |
| Build fails | `build.log`; rerun `build.sh` and inspect the first compiler/linker error |
| Smoke says the app bundle is missing | Run `build.sh`; `smoke-test.sh` requires `build/Silo.app` |
| `statusItem.button` is missing | Confirm the bundle path, `pgrep`, `LSUIElement=false`, the application menu, and launch logs; the status item may exist without the monitor popover being open |
| `monitor.title` or rows are missing | Confirm `--ui-test-open-popover`, rebuild the bundle, then inspect the smoke log and result activities |
| Quit times out | Check `pgrep -x Silo`, query the app log for termination, and close it gracefully with `osascript` |
| Test reports a crash | Inspect the `.xcresult` summary, activities, exported failure attachments, and the unified log; do not rely on the final one-line XCTest failure alone |

Accessibility-driven tools may require Automation/Accessibility permission for
the terminal, Xcode, or test runner. If semantic queries fail while the app is
running, check those permissions before rewriting the test around coordinates.
Do not dismiss an unfamiliar system security or permission dialog blindly.

### Evidence and cleanup checklist

Every investigation report should state:

1. The exact build/test/smoke commands run and their result.
2. The bundle path and whether the observed instance was production or
   `--ui-test-open-popover` mode.
3. The semantic identifiers/actions exercised and observed values.
4. The `smoke-ui.log` and `.xcresult` paths, plus the unified-log predicate and
   time window used.
5. Whether the app was gracefully closed and whether `pgrep -x Silo`
   returned no remaining instance.
6. Which behavior is real implementation versus the current static scaffold.

For the current static fixture, the report must explicitly say that workspace
states are deterministic scaffold values, not live sandbox telemetry. It must
enumerate observed semantic identifiers and values, not only say that the UI
was verified:

- `statusItem.button`: `Silo`; application menu: `Silo`.
- Application menu items: `About Silo`, `Settings…`, `Hide Silo`,
  and `Quit Silo`.
- `monitor.title`: `Silo`.
- `workspace.dev.name/state`: `dev` / `Stopped`;
  `workspace.playgrounds.name/state`: `playgrounds` / `Stopped`;
  `workspace.personal.name/state`: `personal` / `Stopped`.
- `open-monitor.button`: `Open Silo…`; separate Overview, Settings, and
  Setup shortcuts must be absent.
- `quit.button`: `Quit`; clicking it must reach app state `notRunning`.

Keep generated logs and result bundles under `app/Silo/build/`. Do not
publish credentials, raw private paths, user data, security details, or
unredacted system logs.

### Process ownership, stale artifacts, and coverage limits

- Use the canonical bundle path above. Do not launch an installed copy with
  `open -a Silo` or infer behavior from an arbitrary bundle.
- Before a manual launch or smoke run, confirm that no unrelated
  `Silo` instance is already running. If ownership is unclear, inspect
  the process and bundle before acting. Never use `pkill`, `killall`, or a
  guessed PID; do not use `kill -9` as routine cleanup.
- The `Quit` button is the preferred cleanup path. The UI test also terminates
  its launched app in `defer` if an assertion fails. Closing the popover is not
  process cleanup.
- `build.sh` removes the canonical app bundle but does not clear all old Build
  DerivedData. `test.sh` leaves its TestProducts and prior test results.
  `smoke-test.sh` removes the prior `smoke-ui.log`, `smoke-app.log`, and
  `smoke-launch.log`, then recreates its Smoke DerivedData and products. Preserve
  a failing log and exact result bundle before rerunning.
- Do not guess the newest result with a glob. Use the exact
  `Test session results, code coverage, and logs:` path printed by that run.
- The scripts use filtered targets: `test.sh` runs only `SiloTests`;
  `smoke-test.sh` runs `SiloUITests`; `--startup-only` runs
  `testStartupInstallsDependenciesInsideFirstOnboardingStep()`; `--monitor-only`
  runs `testStatusItemMinimalPopoverAndQuit()`; `--repair-only` runs
  `testDedicatedRuntimeRepairClearsEverySurfaceAfterVerifiedReactivation()`;
  `--picker-only` runs
  `testDirectFolderPickerFromStatusPopover()`; `--preferences-only` runs
  `testApplicationPreferencesUpdateWorkspaceActions()`; `--navigation-only`
  runs `testUnifiedWindowUsesTopTabsAndWorkspaceSections()`; `--lifecycle-only`
  runs
  `testUnifiedWindowOwnsLifecycleConfirmationAndVerifiesRestartGap()`;
  `--backup-only` runs `testBackupDestinationSelectionShowsRequiredSpaceConfirmation()`;
  `--backup-result-only` runs
  `testBackupResultCardSuccessPartialAndFailure()`; and
  `--failure-only` runs `testOperationFailureOpensDetailedLogs()`. A bare
  `xcodebuild test` is a different, broader operation and is not a replacement
  for the documented checks.
- UI automation requires an interactive GUI session and may require narrowly
  scoped Automation/Accessibility permission for the launcher or test runner.
  Never reset TCC globally or use `sudo` as a shortcut.
- A passing build proves compilation and bundling; a passing focused smoke
  proves the static status-item/popover, fixture rows, shortcuts, and quit flow.
  It does not prove VM health, `silo` command integration, lifecycle actions,
  telemetry, signing, notarization, or release readiness.
